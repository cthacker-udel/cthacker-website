I am an extrovert and embody a mission of helping others above everything else.

I was born in Christiana Hospital, minutes after my twin brother, so I am the youngest. I grew up with two brothers, who all went to the same kindergarten-middle school. It was a private school with massive green recreational fields with trees surrounding them like a forest; all you could hear was nature when you were alone. The gigantic maze of metal bars and basketball hoops stood next to the retro-looking school, constructed with red brick back when that was the main building ingredient. The walk up to the playground was a long asphalt path that would leave you sweating when you got to the top. We would always play pick-up football in the field behind it after school, with no pads, and get our school uniforms as dirty as can be. We would sneak out of recess and go into the computer lab to play flash player games when we had a supervisor we knew was relaxed."}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"".concat(r().about_me_paragraph),children:"That wasn't the only activity I did besides recess. I did choir and was very good at it; we still have tapes of our recitals in my parent's house, filmed on our old camcorder that you see in 90's nostalgia videos. I went from choir to playing in the school band as a percussionist. My twin played the saxophone. I remember getting my first drum set. I immediately started playing on it until one of my drumsticks broke. It's so tiny now I can't even sit on the seat."}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"".concat(r().about_me_paragraph),children:"During all these musical adventures, I was also playing on a travel soccer team, a local team in Hockessin. We all would meet up at the soccer fields next to the mushroom farms, behind the train tracks, during the week. The drive there would feel like we were entering a different realm, bumpy dirt roads, no buildings, unmarked streets. We would practice drills and play scrimmages until the sun was setting. We went to regional tournaments and even placed 2nd one time! That was a phenomenal achievement for all of us, we were frustrated about not getting first, but we were so proud of having a trophy to show."}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"".concat(r().about_me_paragraph),children:"The minuscule amount of these soccer trophies barely compares to my successful time as a martial artist.

I was a worldwide Tang-Soo-Do competitor, winning local tournaments without a challenge; I had to seek tougher ones.

I received a generous scholarship from Salesianum High School, which was a famous high school known for its sports program and academics. There have been champions of the NFL and the NBA who graduated from there; while I was attending. The school was stellar. I met so many talented and unique people there. That's where I found my drive for Computer Science as well. I was taking an Introductory to Web Applications class, and that was my first experience with Javascript and HTML. I tried to build a beautiful web page and created one about cars. I was amazed by the creations of other students.

I got the letter back, and I was so nervous. I was accepted! I was very joyous that day, knowing I would be moving onto the next stage, where I would formulate and build the foundation of my career. I got accepted into the SEEDS scholarship, which granted students free tuition if they maintained above a 3.0 GPA. I had to take classes in Wilmington, DE, where UD had a remote campus. I took courses there, ones to fill up the requirements. My goal was to reach UD in Newark and take the classes I wanted to take.

Eventually, my performance finally received recognition. Checking my email inbox one morning,  I saw a professor offering me the job of monitoring their lab sessions and grading class assignments. I immediately accepted, haphazardly running to my computer to follow the links they sent to enroll.
