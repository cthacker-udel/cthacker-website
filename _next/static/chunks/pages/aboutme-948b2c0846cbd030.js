Knowledgeable in the fundamentals but also the specifics of languages. I've been learning CS for years now it seems, and have made it my mission to practice every day to always improve my skills. I am primarily self-taught for all my languages, and all my projects, I always make it my mission to put my work out there first and foremost, or else how will I ever be able to describe what it does if I am questioned? I've learned primarily through practice, I read textbooks occasionally, but I've always found that practice really teaches me the most. I always find that helping others teaches me the most about any subject, whether it be CS or generally anything, that's why when I received the offer from the University to become a TA for a Java class, I immediately accepted it, because I've always enjoyed helping others, and providing any assistance for any of their needs. I've been a private tutor, I've helped and mentored interns and my current job as a Junior React Dev. I've even helped people prepare for coding interviews. I've spent countless hours practicing along whether it's with websites like Codewars, Edabit, or LeetCode, and countless others I've found to pique my interests of a viable challenge. My first class was CISC101 - Fundamentals of Computing, and that covered the really, almost trivial basics, and although that class felt like a waste at the time, it actually served a good purpose of building my confidence for the ability to succeed in this subject. I then began to take the two Python courses the school had to offer, CISC106 and CISC108, both which utilized python, I self-taught myself python over the summer before taking CISC108, and I managed to finish the class a full month and a half early. I should've skipped that class, but the relationship I would form with the staff by displaying exceptional skills was ever so worth spending unecessary time taking classes I was already full prepared for. I would then take my skills to Java, which was an entirely new concept to me, an OOP language, something I had not experienced in my previous classes, and I hit that class out of the park, finishing with an 118% in the class due to getting full points on the extra credit and acing all the projects. That journey kept progressing, to learning C, then the linux terminal, then C++, then HTML, CSS, and JS/TS, then SQL and C#. I've learned tons of different concepts and languages over my undergrad education here at UD, and met new friends as well along the way, who all share the same devotion to learning and becoming an excellent computer scientist. Switching subjects off of the Computer Science side of my journey, I've been an athlete all my years growing up, whether it's playing sports, or going to the gym. I am a black belt in Tang-Soo-Do, which is a martial art. I was a travel soccer player for a local team in Hockessin for 10+ years. I practiced lacrosse with my family while my big brother played for his high school, I played baseball, basketball. I went to the gym countless times during my freshman year of college, even eventually being able to bench 440 pounds, which is not so bad for someone who weighs 135. I went to Salesianum High School, where I would further my studies and finish with an average 3.1 gpa, and I decided to apply to UD, which my top choice, and I got accepted! My journey at this institution has been nothing short of amazing, and I can't wait to begin working after graduation, or even taking grad school. I wouldn't of made it this far in my journey as well if it was not for the support of all my friends and family, I have always been a humble person, and I must give gratitude for those who allow me to be my best. I have always been a team worker, and always strived to form friendships, rather then enemies. I'm always the one who tries to ease the situation, and provide a positive light to every negative light out there. As you are reading this, I have most likely committed to my github repo or am currently reading new methodologies, solving new problems, or helping someone out with problems."})]})})},2852:function(e){e.exports={about_me_text:"AboutMe_about_me_text__mPLPq",about_me_text_anim:"AboutMe_about_me_text_anim__GtRez"}},6977:function(e){e.exports={basic_layout:"BasicLayout_basic_layout__zNI5L"}},2689:function(e){e.exports={navbar:"Navbar_navbar__T3Bcs",navbar_link:"Navbar_navbar_link__LTCHA",navbar_link_anim:"Navbar_navbar_link_anim__72uhw",navbar_link_icon:"Navbar_navbar_link_icon___xzRu",navbar_link_icon_anim:"Navbar_navbar_link_icon_anim__JfL39"}}},function(e){e.O(0,[664,774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=7046)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
